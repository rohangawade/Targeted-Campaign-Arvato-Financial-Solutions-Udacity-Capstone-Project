# Targeted-Campaign-Arvato-Financial-Solutions-Udacity-Capstone-Project
Udacity Machine Learning NanoDegree Capstone Project

Bertelsmann, Arvato Financial Solutions client, the mail-order company, wanted to have an efficient way for targeting the customers for their mailing campaign. The project caught my eye as it wanted to provide a solution to the real world data science problem and also covered most of the machine learning concepts, needing to apply them on a real world data.
The two problems I tried solving here are:
Customer Segmentation, where using demographic information of the general population of Germany and the customer demographic information I tried representing them in cluster groups
Supervised Learning, where I created model to predict if the person will respond to mailing campaign or not.

At the end the predictions are submitted in Kaggle Competition, where my got scored 0.719 ROC AUC.
